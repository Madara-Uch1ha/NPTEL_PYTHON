'''Write a Python function splitsum(l) that takes a nonempty list of integers and returns a list [pos,neg], where pos is the sum of squares all the positive numbers in l and neg is the sum of cubes of all the negative numbers in l.

Here are some examples to show how your function should work.

'''A two dimensional matrix can be represented in Python row-wise, as a list of lists: each inner list represents one row of the matrix. For instance, the matrix

1  2  3
4  5  6 
7  8  9
would be represented as [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]].

A horizonatal flip reflects each row. For instance, if we flip the previous matrix horizontally, we get

3  2  1
6  5  4 
9  8  7
which would be represented as [[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [9, 8, 7]].

A vertical flip reflects each column. For instance, if we flip the previous matrix that has already been flipped horizontally, we get

9  8  7
6  5  4 
3  2  1
which would be represented as [[9, 8, 7], [6, 5, 4], [3, 2, 1]].

Write a Python function matrixflip(m,d) that takes as input a two dimensional matrix m and a direction d, where d is either 'h' or 'v'. If d == 'h', the function should return the matrix flipped horizontally. If d == 'v', the function should retun the matrix flipped vertically. For any other value of d, the function should return m unchanged. In all cases, the argument m should remain undisturbed by the function.

Here are some examples to show how your function should work. You may assume that the input to the function is always a non-empty matrix.

>>> myl = [[1,2],[3,4]]

>>> myl
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]  

>>> matrixflip(myl,'h')
[[2, 1], [4, 3]]

>>> myl
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]  

>>> matrixflip(myl,'v')
[[3, 4], [1, 2]]  

>>> myl
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]  

>>> matrixflip(matrixflip(myl,'h'),'v')
[[4, 3], [2, 1]]

>>> myl
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]  

>>> matrixflip(matrixflip(myl,'h'),'v')
[[4, 3], [2, 1]]

>>> myl
[[1, 2], [3, 4]]'''
